# 🧠 CNN Image Classification using TensorFlow & Keras

This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow and Keras, designed to classify images effectively. The project is structured in a Jupyter Notebook format, making it beginner-friendly and easy to follow.

## 📌 Features

- ✅ Image preprocessing using TensorFlow Datasets
- ✅ CNN architecture using Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, and Dense layers
- ✅ Training and validation with visualizations
- ✅ Evaluation with accuracy metrics
- ✅ Easily customizable for other image datasets

## 📁 Files

- CNN_network.ipynb - The main notebook containing the complete pipeline from data loading to evaluation.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- NumPy
